Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh!
Welcome to Russia!

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh!

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh!
From love!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh!

Hear voice of Russia
The big bears talking
Vodka, Garmoshka, Babushka still shocking
Forty-seventh is clicking, so fuck you!
Squatting dance till the morning, fuck you!
Hooray winter comes, they won't get us
Share our secret, we're kings of the great mess!

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh!
With Russia
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh!
From love!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh!
With Russia
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh!
From love!
